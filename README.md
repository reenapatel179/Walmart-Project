# Brief Project Description

Does Walmart sales affect the recruiting?

We will be using historical sales data from serval Walmart stores located in different regions to predict if the Walmart store sales affect the recruiting?
Our dataset includes Walmartâ€™s several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.
